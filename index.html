					<li>Exam Management System<br>
						<p style="font-size: smaller">In this project, A professor is able to add questions to the bank and use selected
						questions to create an exam. Students then login to take the exam, submit, and the exam is autograded.
						Professor logs back in to review the exam and can modify their grade. Professor then update new grade and
						release scores to students to see the grade and review exam. For this project, I was mainly responsible
						for the layout/design of the website and how the date from the database is displayed.</p></li>
